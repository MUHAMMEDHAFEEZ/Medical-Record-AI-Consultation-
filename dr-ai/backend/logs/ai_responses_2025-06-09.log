DIAGNOSIS: Based on your medical history and current symptoms, the most likely cause is an exacerbation of asthma due to exposure to triggers such as cold air or viral infections. This could also be a sign of hypertension if it's not well controlled. We recommend starting with bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory medications, and considering lifestyle changes to manage stress and improve overall health. Regular follow-ups are crucial for monitoring your condition and adjusting treatment as needed. (Medical advice only).

DIAGNOSIS: Based on your medical history and current symptoms, the most likely cause is an exacerbation of asthma due to exposure to triggers such as cold air or viral infections. This could also be a sign of hypertension if it's not well controlled. We recommend starting with bronchodilators and anti-inflammatory medications, and considering lifestyle changes to manage stress and improve overall health. Regular follow-ups are crucial for monitoring your condition and adjusting treatment as needed. (Medical advice only).

DIAGNOSIS: Based on your medical history and current symptoms, the most likely cause is an asthma exacerbation. This can be triggered by viral infections like colds, which you mentioned are common triggers for your asthma. The treatment plan should include a course of oral corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and improve lung function.
